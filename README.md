# social_media_campaign_analytics

## About Project

This project aims to analyze social media data for a client to uncover insights that can improve their digital marketing strategy. The project was completed as part of the "Hack the Feed" hackathon, hosted by Playhouse Communication.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to:

* Understand the client's social media audience and engagement patterns.
* Identify key trends and insights from the data.
* Develop actionable recommendations for the client to improve their social media marketing strategy.
## Key Questions

* What are the client's most popular social media platforms?
* When are the client's followers most active on social media?
* What types of content are most engaging for the client's audience?
* Are there any specific hashtags that are performing well for the client?
## Key Insights

The following key insights were uncovered from the social media data analysis:

* Facebook is the client's most dominant platform, accounting for nearly half of total engagement.
* Morning (10:00 am - 11:00 am), afternoon (2:00 pm - 3:00 pm), and evening (5:00 pm - 6:00 pm) are high-engagement times for the client's audience.
* Photos and videos are the most engaging types of content.
* The #CHNWMassRetail hashtag is a top performer, reaching a large audience and driving significant engagement.
## Recommendations

Based on the key insights, the following recommendations are made for the client to improve their social media marketing strategy:

* Post more frequently, especially during peak activity times, and actively respond to comments and messages to reconnect with and engage our online audience.
* Use #CHNWMassRetail more frequently in our posts and explore similar effective hashtags to boost content visibility and interaction.
* Prioritize sharing engaging photos and videos while experimenting with different visual content formats like live videos and creative graphics to maintain audience interest.
